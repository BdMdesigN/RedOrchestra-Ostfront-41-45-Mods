A dog-bot I found in KF.
Should serve as base for creating Soviet Anti-Tank dogs carrying special satchel charges.

I broke it down into anims, textures and sounds.
I re-did the mesh and relinked the animations and sound notifies.
Fixed a small bug in the sound group, causing the attack sound to be always the same.
