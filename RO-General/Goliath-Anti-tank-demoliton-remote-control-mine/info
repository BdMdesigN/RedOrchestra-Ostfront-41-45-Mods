//This is an experiment I conducted, in order to make a remote controlled vehicle.
//This was supposed to be used as a base for the german Goliath Remote Controlled Anti-tank (demolition) Mine.
//What is this???
//Following the Soviets and their success at making a full scale remote controlled tank, ("TeleTank"

during th winter war  (Russo-Finish war between Soviet Union and Finland)
//The german engineers decided to implement a similar idea:
//This is a remote control tracked mine, a remote controlled vehicle.
//It has a small petrol or twin Bosch electric motors, and was used to safely destroy heavy/slow tanks from a distance up to 400 meters,
//using a small and simple remote control
//The control was achieved by a long wire, that was stored on a spool inside the Goliath itself.
//As the vehicle advanced towards the enemy tank, or a  static defence, the cord would pull itself out from the spool.
//The downside of this mine was its slow speed, requirement to have visual on the target during the advance, and its low mechanic reliability, 
//The charge was detonated through the same remote.
